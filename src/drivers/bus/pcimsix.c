 * PCI MSI-X interrupts
 *
 * Interrupts as such are not used in iPXE, which operates in polling
 * mode.  However, some network cards (such as the Intel 40GbE and
 * 100GbE NICs) will defer writing out completions until the point of
 * asserting an MSI-X interrupt.
 *
 * From the point of view of the PCI device, asserting an MSI-X
 * interrupt is just a 32-bit DMA write of an opaque value to an
 * opaque target address.  The PCI device has no know to know whether
 * or not the target address corresponds to a real APIC.
 *
 * We can therefore trick the PCI device into believing that it is
 * asserting an MSI-X interrupt, by configuring it to write an opaque
 * 32-bit value to a dummy target address in host memory.  This is
 * sufficient to trigger the associated write of the completions to
 * host memory.
 *
 * When running in a virtual machine, the hypervisor will intercept
 * our attempt to configure MSI-X on the PCI device.  The physical
 * hardware will be configured to raise an interrupt under the
 * hypervisor's control, which will then be reflected back into the
 * virtual machine.  The opaque value that we write will be assumed to
 * indicate an interrupt vector number (as would normally be the case
 * when configuring MSI-X), and the opaque address will generally be
 * ignored.  The reflected interrupt will be ignored (since it is not
 * enabled within the virtual machine), but the device still asserts
 * an MSI-X interrupt and so still triggers the associated write of
 * the completions to host memory.
 *
 * Note that since the opaque target address will generally be ignored
 * by the hypervisor, we cannot examine the value present at the dummy
 * target address to find out whether or not an interrupt has been
 * raised.
